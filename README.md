## Code Snippets
The following snipept is a showcase of the Inquirer NPM package, and how it's precisely used in order to make the code function. In order to make sure everything a professional README document requires for an open-source project has been included, a total of 9 prompts have been prepared.
```java
inquirer
    .prompt([
        {
            type:'input',
            message:"What's the name of your project?",
            name: 'title'
        },
        {
            type: 'input',
            message: 'Please provide your project a description.',
            name: 'description'
        },
        {
            type: 'input',
            message: 'Please describe the installation process to serve as an instruction.',
            name: 'installation'
        },
        {
            type: 'input',
            message: 'Now, please provide usage information for your project.',
            name: 'usage'
        },
        {
            type: 'input',
            message: 'Please pick an application license from the list (AGPL, GPL, LGPL, MPL, Apache, MIT, N/A).',
            name: 'license',
            choices: ['AGPL', 'GPL', 'LGPL', 'MPL', 'Apache', 'MIT', 'N/A']
        },
        {
            type: 'input',
            message: 'Next, please input your guidelines for potential contributions to your project.',
            name: 'contribution'
        },
        {
            type: 'input',
            message: 'Please provide instructions for testing.',
            name: 'test'
        },
        {
            message: "Enter your GitHub username",
            name: "username"
        },
        {
            type: 'input',
            message: "Last, but not least, please leave an email address when you need to be contacted.",
            name: "email"
        },
    ])
```
Additionally, the second to last prompt is an integration of the axios package. It was used to fetch a variety of information from the user through the Github API by prompting their username.
```java
	axios.get(queryUrl).then(function(res) {
		.
		.
		.
		readName = res.data.name;
		.
		.
		.
	}
```
